# Welcome to my React Portfolio

I have applied what I've learned in JavaScript and React to create a new portfolio.
It's been fun trying out new libraries and ways to style my code.
One of the libraries I've learnt for this portfolio was Motion, and the other was Styled-components, two things I've never used before.
